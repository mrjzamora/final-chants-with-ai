"USA, Let's Go!"

Verse 1:
(Lively Beat Starts)
(Clap, clap, clap)
Come on, come on, USA, (Hey!)
On the field, we shine today, (Hey!)
From the third minute on,
Pulisic led the way.

Pre-Chorus:
Weah with the assist,
Balogun found the net,
With Pepi and Cardoso strong,
Bolivia couldn't compete.

Chorus:
(Beat Intensifies)
Ooooh, USA,
With passion and heart,
Ooooh, USA,
We’re on to victory,
Ooooh, USA,
With Pulisic and Reyna,
Ooooh, USA,
The win is ours.

Verse 2:
In the forty-fourth minute,
Balogun scored again,
With Pulisic's perfect pass,
The score was set to win.

From the bench came Aaronson,
De la Torre joined the play,
With Musah and Pepi,
We’re winning all the way.

Bridge:
(Spoken in energetic, rhythmic style)
USA on the field, always strong, never yield,
From New York to LA, our fans will never sway,
With rhythm and pride, we’ll keep the dream alive,
This team is on the rise, never stopping, always thrive.

Chorus:
(Clap, clap, clap)
Come on, come on, USA, (Hey!)
We’ll fight with all our might, (Hey!)
Every goal that we score here,
Is a cheer for the red, white, and blue.

Outro:
(Lively Beat Plays Out)
(Clap, clap, clap)
Come on, come on, USA, (Hey!)
In every game, we’ll triumph, (Hey!)
Every goal that we score here,
Is a cheer for the red, white, and blue.
